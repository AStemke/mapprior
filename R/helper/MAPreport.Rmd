```

## Meta Analytic Predcitive Prior

This report is automatically generated and provides MAP Priors for a `r struc` endpoint with `r `.


```{r cars}
plot(out1[[1]])$`forest_model`
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
4+5
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
